# php-mysql-web-development
This repository contains my PHP-based web application using MySQL database management system with CRUD operations. Built with modern web technologies like PHP 8, OOPs concepts, JavaScript/AJAX, HTML5/CSS3 and Bootstrap Framework while working with databases like MySQL/Firebase. Created during my internship at Hidaya.
